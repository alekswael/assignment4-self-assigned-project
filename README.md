## About the project

### Data

### Model

### Pipeline

## Requirements

The code is tested on Python 3.11.2. Futhermore, if your OS is not UNIX-based, a bash-compatible terminal is required for running shell scripts (such as Git for Windows).

## Usage

The repo was setup to work with Windows (the WIN_ files), MacOS and Linux (the MACL_ files).

### 1. Clone repository to desired directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AU-CDS/assignment3-pretrained-cnns-alekswael
cd assignment3-pretrained-cnns-alekswael
```
### 2. Run setup script 
**NOTE:** Depending on your OS, run either `WIN_setup.sh` or `MACL_setup.sh`.

The setup script does the following:
1. Creates a virtual environment for the project
2. Activates the virtual environment
3. Installs the correct versions of the packages required
5. Deactivates the virtual environment

```bash
bash WIN_setup.sh
```

### 3. Run pipeline
**NOTE:** Depending on your OS, run either `WIN_run.sh` or `MACL_run.sh`.

Run the script in a bash terminal.

The script does the following:
1. Activates the virtual environment
2. Runs `cnn_fashion.py` located in the `src` folder
3. Deactivates the virtual environment
```bash
bash WIN_run.sh
```
